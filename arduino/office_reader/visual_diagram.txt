System Components Explanation:
=============================

1. Control Box:
   - Houses the Arduino Uno microcontroller
   - Contains Ethernet shield for network connectivity
   - Power supply for the system
   - Typically mounted in a secure location or IT closet

2. Wall Mount Interface:
   - MFRC522 RFID reader for scanning cards
   - WS2812B status LED indicator
   - Registration button
   - Clean, user-friendly design for office environment
   - Mounted near entrance or administrator's desk

3. Operation Flow:
   a. Registration Process:
      - Administrator presses registration button
      - Status LED flashes green (indicating ready to register)
      - RFID card is placed on reader
      - Status LED turns purple (indicating card detected)
      - Administrator presses button again to confirm
      - System sends RFID to server for registration
      - Status LED indicates success (green flashes) or failure (red flashes)
   
   b. Normal Operation:
      - Status LED is solid blue when idle
      - System ready for next registration
      - Connected to central server through Ethernet

4. Status Indicators:
   - Blue: System idle, ready for operation
   - Green (flashing): Registration mode active
   - Purple: RFID card scanned, waiting for confirmation
   - Yellow: Connecting to server
   - Green (flashing 3x): Registration successful
   - Red (flashing 3x): Registration failed

5. Physical Installation:
   - Simple, clean wall-mounted enclosure
   - Minimal exposed components
   - Professional office appearance
   - Status LED clearly visible
   - Button easy to access but not prone to accidental presses

6. Integration:
   - Connects to the same central server as machine monitors
   - Registers cards into the database for later machine access
   - Can be placed at reception or administrator's desk

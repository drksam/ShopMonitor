System Components Explanation:
=============================

1. Control Panel:
   - Houses the Arduino Mega microcontroller
   - Contains status indicator LEDs (WS2812B)
   - Network connection (Ethernet Shield)
   - Power supply for the system

2. Machine Zone:
   - Each machine has its own zone (up to 4 per controller)
   - Power relay to control machine power
   - Activity sensor to detect machine usage
   - RFID reader for user authentication

3. Operation Flow:
   - User scans RFID tag at reader
   - Arduino verifies authorization with server
   - If authorized, relay activates allowing machine to operate
   - Activity sensor monitors machine usage
   - Status LEDs indicate current state of each machine
   - Activity counts are sent to server periodically
   - Inactivity triggers timeout warning and eventual shutdown

4. Status Indicators:
   - Blue: Machine idle, ready for use
   - Green: User authorized, machine active
   - Red: Access denied
   - Purple: User logging out, machine shutting down
   - Yellow (flashing): Inactivity warning

5. Physical Layout:
   - Control panel is centrally located
   - RFID readers positioned at each machine
   - Activity sensors connected directly to machines
   - Power relays inline with machine power supply

6. Scalability:
   - Each Arduino Mega controls up to 4 machines
   - Multiple controllers can be deployed throughout facility
   - All controllers connect to central server

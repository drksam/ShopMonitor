NOTES:
- All RFID modules share the same SPI bus (MOSI, MISO, SCK) but have different SS and RST pins
- Each zone has its own RGB LED (or separate LEDs) for status indication
- The activity monitoring inputs can be connected to current sensors, voltage signals, or simple switch contacts
- Relays are used to control power to the machines or to enable their control circuits
- The Ethernet module provides network communication to the central server
- A buzzer provides audio feedback for card scans

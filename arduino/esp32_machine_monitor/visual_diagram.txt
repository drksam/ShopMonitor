System Components Explanation:
=============================

1. Control Panel:
   - ESP32 microcontroller with integrated WiFi
   - Status indicator LEDs (WS2812B)
   - Four RFID-RC522 readers via SPI
   - Power supply
   - Web configuration interface

2. Machine Zones:
   - Up to 4 independent machine zones per ESP32
   - Each zone includes:
     * Power relay to control machine power
     * Activity sensor to detect machine usage
     * RFID reader for user authentication

3. Web Configuration UI:
   - Accessible via browser on the local network
   - Responsive design works on mobile devices
   - Provides real-time status monitoring
   - Allows configuration changes
   - Supports OTA firmware updates
   - RFID user management capabilities
   - Network configuration settings
   - Troubleshooting and diagnostics tools

4. Enhanced Features vs. Arduino Version:
   - WiFi connectivity (vs. Ethernet)
   - Built-in configuration web interface
   - OTA (Over-The-Air) update capability
   - mDNS discovery for auto-detection
   - Better handling of offline access
   - Improved memory and processing power
   - JSON-based configuration storage
   - More robust networking capabilities
   
5. Operation Flow:
   - User scans RFID tag at reader
   - ESP32 verifies authorization with server
   - If authorized, relay activates allowing machine to operate
   - Activity sensor monitors machine usage
   - Status LEDs indicate current state of each machine
   - Activity counts are sent to server periodically
   - Inactivity triggers timeout warning and eventual shutdown
   - Configuration can be adjusted via web interface

6. Status Indicators:
   - Blue: Machine idle, ready for use
   - Green: User authorized, machine active
   - Red: Access denied
   - Purple: User logging out, machine shutting down
   - Yellow (flashing): Inactivity warning

7. Physical Installation:
   - Control panel centrally located
   - RFID readers positioned at each machine
   - Activity sensors connected directly to machines
   - Power relays inline with machine power supply
   - WiFi connectivity to network

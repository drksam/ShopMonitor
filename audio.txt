the ESP32(CYD) needs audio capabilities
it needs to receive an audio stream from a network broadcast 
--this broadcast needs to be from a separate pc (not one running ShopMonitor) so it should be self contained
--the pc side should show up as an audio output in PipeWire (NO WINDOWS OR MAC SUPPORT)
--there should be no ip or mac or id settings for this feature. 
---all (CYD) firmware devices on the network should automatically receive the stream.
the audio needs to be sent to the (CYD)'s built in audio out
the audio needs to be broadcasted out to multi-point Bluetooth
there needs to be a ui for config of bluetooth devices and builtin audio volume
the (CYD) needs to be able to make an alert sound when it gets an alert 
the audio needs to be silenced if any estop on the system is pressed.
small latency (especially between bluetooth and built in audio) is fine. 
prioritize a balance between accurate timing and audio quality.
the (CYD) does NOT need any audio controls like play skip or pause ONLY volume and bluetooth connection
